Hello, I have a small project in JavaScript. This is my first project and I'm very happy to do it.
This project asks a player some riddles. When he answers, 
the program gives him the total time it took to answer, and the average time for each riddle individually.

I will start with the classes:
I have two classes â€” one for the "Riddle", and another for the "Player".
I use ES modules to export and import files.
Actually, I use default export.
